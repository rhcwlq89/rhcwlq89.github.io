        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm a backend developer with hands-on experience building
          services based on Spring Boot and AWS. I run this blog to
          systematically organize the insights gained from solving technical
          challenges in real-world projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Blog Mission</h2>
        <p>
          This blog aims to provide practical, hands-on technical content.
          Rather than simple theory summaries, it delivers project-ready
          architectures, code examples, and lessons learned from trial and
          error.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Topics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Spring Boot</strong> — Project setup, logging strategies,
            exception handling, production patterns, and series guides
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AWS</strong> — EC2, RDS, CLI, database selection guides, and
            cloud infrastructure best practices
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Databases</strong> — Design, optimization, and solutions to
            common production issues
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interview Preparation</strong> — Core concepts for technical
            interview preparation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Value for Readers</h2>
        <p>
          Every article is written with the question "Can I apply this right
          now?" in mind. We provide the practical context that official docs
          alone cannot convey — configuration pitfalls, reasoning behind design
          choices, and actionable takeaways.
        </p>
